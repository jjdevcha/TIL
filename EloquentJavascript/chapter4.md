# Chapter 4 Data structures: Objects and arrays

#### Properties

#### Methods
Properties that contain functions are genereally called methods
`string.toUpperCase()`
<br>
`array.push()`

#### Mutability
Object values can be modified - The types such as numbers, strings, and Booleans, are all immutable. 

#### Correlation
`0` : The variables are not related
`1` : Two are perfectly related
`-1` : The variables are perfectly related but that they are opposites - one is true, the other is false

##### Phi coefficient 
ϕ =	
n11n00 − n10n01
√ n1•n0•n•1n•0

#### Rest parameters
`function max(...numbers)`
<br>
The rest parameter is bound to an array containing all further arguments

#### JSON
Serialized data. JavaScript Object Notation

##### JSON.stringify()
Makes a object to a string value

##### JSON.parse()

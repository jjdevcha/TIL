# Proxy
It's a middleware for client and server for security reasons. 
If you are a student wanting to borrow a book that needs a librarian's permission, 
you are the client, librarian is the proxy, and the library is server. 

## Why use a proxy
1. Privacy: Hiding your identity from servers
2. Security: Blocking harmful stuff
3. Access control: Allow of block certain requests
4. Speed: Storing responses(cache)
